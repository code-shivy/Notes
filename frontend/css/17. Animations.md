Transitions:

A CSS module for smoothly transitioning between values when a value is changed. Transitions can be defined with a combination of these properties:

- **transition-property**: The name of the CSS property to transition.
- **transition-duration**: How long the transition should take place.
- **transition-timing-function**: How transition should progress. This can take a variety of keywords values, such as linear and ease-in, or custom values using cubic-bezier() or steps() functions.
- **transition-delay**: How long to wait before starting the transition.

example:
- This basically makes sure that upon hover the width increases and it takes 1sec.

Alternatively, the transition property can be used as a shorthand for all of these values. The first time value will be used for the duration, and the second will be used for a delay. Other than that, the order does not matter.

For example: 
` transition: width 1s linear 2s;`

- If we need to transition multiple properties like width and transform rotate:

This basically uses both width and transform with their own duration and transition-timing-function.
