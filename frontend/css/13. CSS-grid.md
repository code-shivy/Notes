CSS grid:
A layout model used for creating responsive layouts of multiple rows and columns. An element can be made a grid container with display: grid,
and all of it's direct children will automatically be laid out as grid items in a single cell.

A rectangular subsection of a grid is known as a grid area. The dividers between each row and column are known as grid lines and the rows
and columns they create are called tracks. 

For grid containers, there are some of the most common properties used to layout their grid items:
- grid-template-columns: Determines the number of columns and their sizes. The unit fr (fraction unit) can be used as a fractional unit here to create a responsive design.

- grid-template-rows: Determines the number of rows and their sizes. The unit fr can be used as a fractional unit here to create a responsive design.

- grid-template-areas: Creates name for grid aread that grid items can place themselves in.

- justify-content: Determines how grid tracks are aligned along the inline-axis (row) with possible values including start,end,center,space-around,space-between and space-evenly.

- align-content: Determines how grid tracks are aligned along the block-axis (column) with possible values including start,end,center,space-around,space-between and space-evenly.

- align-items: Determines how grid items are aligned in columns  (called the block-axis). Possible values including start,end,center, and stretch.

- justify-items: Determines how grid items are aligned in rows(called the inline-axis). Possible values including start,end,center, and stretch.

- place-items: A shorthand for both align-items and justify-items. If one value is given, it will apply to both. If two values are given, they will apply to align-items and justify-items respectively.

- gap: Determines the amount of space between grid items, This can take one or two length values. If it is given two, they will be treated as a row gap and a column gap. Alternatively, a row-gap and column-gap property can be specified to individually set the gap between rows and columns.
