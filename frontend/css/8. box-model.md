   to create rounded corners on an element, regardless of if it has a border. This defines the radius of the corners, and a value of 50% is often used on square elements to create a circle.
 Additionally, border-top, border-right,border-bottom and border-left can be used to set borders on a single side of an element. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border

   A value of auto can also be used to allow the browser to choose margins, which will usually center block elements horizontally.
   Adjacent horizontal margins will be added together to determine the space between elements. Vertical margins on the other hand will usually be collapsed
   meaning only the larger margin value will be used.
