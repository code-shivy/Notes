Box-sizing: 
A css property for specifying how width and height should be calculated for the selected element. The defult value is content-box for most elements, 
which sets the width and height to only control the size of the content. However, a value of border-box would include the size of the padding and border.

For example: if an element has width: 100px, padding 12px and border: 24px, then with box-sizing: content-box it would take up a total of 172px of width
(Note: this includes padding and border twice to account for the left and right side). However, with box-sizing: border-box it would only take up a total width of 100px.

In here teh child is overflowing the container even if width is 100% of container, it is hapenning due to border:10px and padding:12px; 
so border is 20px and padding is 24 px overflowing.  We can solve this using width: calc(100% - 20px -24px), but here the value is hardcoded and it is not clean code. The solution is box-sizing. ![Screenshot 2025-01-18 at 2 58 25 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ce2e85d-9eb5-4582-96f6-f68a5e26a79d)
