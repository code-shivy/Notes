Box-sizing: 
A css property for specifying how width and height should be calculated for the selected element. The defult value is content-box for most elements, 
which sets the width and height to only control the size of the content. However, a value of border-box would include the size of the padding and border.

For example: if an element has width: 100px, padding 12px and border: 24px, then with box-sizing: content-box it would take up a total of 172px of width
(Note: this includes padding and border twice to account for the left and right side). However, with box-sizing: border-box it would only take up a total width of 100px.
