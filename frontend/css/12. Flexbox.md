Flexbox: 
A layout model, also known as the flexible box layout module, particularly used for building responsive designs with row or column layouts.
An element can be made a flex container with display: flex, and all of it's direct children will automatically be laid out as flex items.

For flex containers, these are some of the most common properties used to layout their flex items:

- flex-direction: Determines which direction is hte main-axis, either row or column. Additionally, row-reverse and column-reverse can be
  used to reverse the order of flex items.
  
- justify-content: Determines how elements are positioned along the main-axis with possible values of flex-start, flex-end, center,
  space-around, space-betrween, and space-evenly.
  
- align-items: Determines how elements are positioned along the cross-axis (the one not selected by flex-direction). Possible values are
  flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.
  
- flex-wrap: Determines if flex items can wrap to new lines with possible values of wrap and nowrap. wrap-reverse can also be used
  to wrap flex items with the lines in reverse order.

- align-content: Determines how lines are positioned along the cross-axis when flex items are wrapping on multiple lines. Possible values are
  flex-start, flex-end, center, space-around, space-betrween, and stretch.

- flex-flow: A shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap.
  
- gap: Determines the amount of space between flex items. This can take one or two lenght values. If it is given two, they will be treated as a row
  gap and a column gap respectively. Alternatively, a row-gap and column-gap property can be specified to individually set the gap between rows and columns.
