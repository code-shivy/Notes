All properties are either inherited properties or inherited properties. Inherited properties will take their parents value in the case no value has been set to the property.
Non-inherited properties on the other hand will set to initial in this case.

While default groupings of inherited and non-inherited properties is usually all that's needed, this can be changed by using
any of these values for any declaration:

- inherit: The value should inherit from its parent, regardless of if it is normally inherited property.
- initial: The value should be set to the value defined in the CSS specification. Noite this is oftentimes different from browser defaults.
- unset: The value should be set to inherit if it is normally an inherited property, otherwise initial. This can be useful for "resetting"
browser defaults.
- revert: The value should revert back to the next stylesheet in the cascade. For author stylesheets, this would act as if the author did not write any declaration for the property,but it would still honor the user agent and user stylesheets as normal.
