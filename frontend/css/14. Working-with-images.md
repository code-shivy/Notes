Image Sprite: A group of images all included in a single image file. The images are usually split on the client using the CSS 
background-image property along with background-position. 

The primary benefit of sprites is to reduce the total file size and the number of files the client needs to download, 
which can decrease page load times. 

background-size: contain; // contains size of the imahe

background-repeat: no-repeat; // helps in non repeating of image

background-origin: border-box; // image starts at the top left of the border, rather than inside the border.

background-clip: content-box; //clips the image to fit the image.
