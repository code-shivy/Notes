position:

A CSS property for setting how the browser should position an element in the document. This defaults to static, but can take a variety of values:

a. Static: The default value, the element fllows the flow of the document.

b. fixed: The element is positioned relative to the viewportand removed from the normal flow of the document. The top, left, right and bottom properties can be used to move the element. Usually it is not considered since it can cover other elements on the UI, which is not a good UX.

c. relative: The element is placed at the same place as it would be with static, however, it can be repositioned with top,right, left and bottom
relative to it's position on the document.

d. sticky: The element will act similar to a relative positioned element, but once it scrolls off screen it will stay fixed to the screen,
essentially acting as position: fixed. This is particular useful for menu bars that need to "stick" to the top of the screen as the user scrolls.

e. absolute: by default, this will act the same as fixed, except the element will be positioned relative to the document instead of the viewport. 
This means that, as the page is scrolled, it will move with the page rather stay at the same viewport location. However, if any element above it in the DOM,
oftentimes referred to as an ancestor, has a position value other than static, then it will be positioned relative to that nearest positioned ancestor. 

We can use float to position a box, it basically lets below content to wrap around the float element especially with image. like:

Then we can use clear to put text away from floating elements like in this example the left box is bigger so due to this clear: left brings the text in next line, otherwise clear is used with right as well to avoid floating elements at right side:
