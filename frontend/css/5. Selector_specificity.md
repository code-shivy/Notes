Specifity: is the algorithm used by the browser to determine which CSS declarations to use when an element is selected by two rulesets with the same property. 

Specificity is roughly calculated by counting the number of each selector type involved in a selector and multiplying by a weight, these weights are as follows:
```
 a. Inline Styles: 1000
 b. IDs: 100
 c. Classes: 10
 d. Pseudo-Classes: 10
 e. Attributes: 10
 f. Elements: 1
 g. Pseudo-Elements: 1
```
