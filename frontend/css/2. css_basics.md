1. Used to describe style and layout of HTML documents. CSS is called cascading style sheets.
2. Cascading means order in which browser decides between style sheets:
   a. User Agent Stylesheets: default browser defaults, for example it contains default font size for different types of heading,
   these get lowest level of precedence. 
   b. User Stylesheets: contains user saved preferences in the browser, which override user agent stylesheets.
   c. Author Stylesheets: contains css code the author of the website writes, these get the highest precedence. (assuming !important has not been used).
4. CSS declaration block:
    {
     color: blue;
     margin: 10px;
     }
5. Ruleset: it has a selector followed by a declaration blockfor styling elements matching the selector.
    selector{
       property: value;
       property: value;
         }
6. linking to HTML: a self closing html tag to external resources, usually CSS stylesheets. for ex: <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

for example:
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>I am a paragraph</p>

css:
h1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: darkblue;
  font-weight: normal;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

  p {
    background-color: darkblue;
    color: white
    min-height: 100px;
    font-size: 1.25rem;
    wedth: 30%;
  }
