1. Paragraph & Headings
The <p> tag is the fundamental block for text content, able to hold both text and other elements. 
Headings range from <h1> to <h6>, with h1 being your main heading and subsequent numbers for subheadings of decreasing importance.

2. Images & Attributes
The <img> tag is self-closing and requires two key attributes: src for the image location and alt for accessibility text. 
for example: <img src="img/dog.png" alt="dog" />
This ensures images are both displayable and accessible.

3. List Structures
HTML offers two main list types: unordered (<ul>) for bullet points and ordered (<ol>) for numbered sequences. 
Both use <li> for individual items. Lists can be nested inside each other for complex hierarchies, like creating subtasks or subcategories.
for example: 
<ul>
  <li>Shubham</li>
  <li>Shivy</li>
  <li>Frontend</li>
</ul>

<ol> is used for a list where order matters, by default most browsers will show this as a numbered list
<ol>
  <li>Shubham</li>
  <li>Shivy</li>
  <li>Frontend</li>
</ol>

4. <pre> 
this is a preformatted text tag, this tag preserves whitespaces which can be useful when indentation and newlines need to be preserved. 
for example:
<pre>
      *
    *****
   *******
  *********
</pre>

5. <br> 
This is line break tag, is used to create a line break in text, for example:
<p>
  Dear User, <br />
  We hope you are enjoying!
</p>

6. <a> 
The anchor tag used to linkn another pages. The tag should include href attribute with the path to the page being linked. 
For example:
<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>

7. <em> 
the emphasis tag usually rendered as italics by default in browser
for example: <p> I <em>need</em> to study! </p>

8. <strong>
It usually rendered as bold by default in browser
for example: <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is important!</p>
