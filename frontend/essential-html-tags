1. Paragraph & Headings
The <p> tag is the fundamental block for text content, able to hold both text and other elements. 
Headings range from <h1> to <h6>, with h1 being your main heading and subsequent numbers for subheadings of decreasing importance.

2. Images & Attributes
The <img> tag is self-closing and requires two key attributes: src for the image location and alt for accessibility text. 
for example: <img src="img/dog.png" alt="dog" />
This ensures images are both displayable and accessible.

3. List Structures
HTML offers two main list types: unordered (<ul>) for bullet points and ordered (<ol>) for numbered sequences. 
Both use <li> for individual items. Lists can be nested inside each other for complex hierarchies, like creating subtasks or subcategories.
for example: 
<ul>
  <li>Shubham</li>
  <li>Shivy</li>
  <li>Frontend</li>
</ul>

<ol> is used for a list where order matters, by default most browsers will show this as a numbered list
<ol>
  <li>Shubham</li>
  <li>Shivy</li>
  <li>Frontend</li>
</ol>
