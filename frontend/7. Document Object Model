DOM is the programming interface for interacting with an HTML document represented as a tree data structure. 
Each HTML element in the document is a node in the DOM tree, with nested content represented as a child in the tree.

It basically:
1. Provides us with an API.
2. Helps browser be aware of HTML elements present.
