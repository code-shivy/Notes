1. It is an html tag for representing data with rows and columns. Anything that can go in a spreadsheet can go in a table.
2. There are multiple tags associated with tables:
<tr> : A single row in the table.
<th> : A heading in the table. This should be used with the scope attribute of either row or col to choose what the content is a heading for.
<td> : A single piece of data in the table, also referred to as a cell.
<thead> : A grouping tag for the heading of a table, usually containing a single <tr> with column headings.
<tbody> : A grouping tag for the body of the table, used for containing the primary rows of data.
<tfoot> : A grouping tag for the footer of the table.
<caption> : A caption or title for the table.

3. Scope attribute can be used with the tag to make html semantically more correct. 
  for example, scope tells that category is column attribute and Food and Entertainment, so anyone looking can understand if the variable is related to a row or column.: 
  <th scope="col">Category</th>
      <th scope="col">Budget</th>
      <th scope="col">Spending</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Food</th>
      <td>$200</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Entertainment</th>
      <td>$250</td>
      <td>$300</td>
