The cPU has a lot of control logic to decode and execute instructions. Execution does the calculation and cache layer is used as memory, general idea is in order to get a good performance you'd need to reduce the latency between layers. 

GPUs have many more executions units and also multiple control units. Key point is that large GPUs hsve a lot more execution layer which gives more throughput through these units by scheduling many parallel tasks.
